In our adventure in software development, we will almost always hit a spot where we might get stuck and need a bit of help. We try, vigorously, to find a solution to our answers. We go to utilize Google search, trying every possible combination of words that might get us to our answer, however, to no avail. We try to search for any possible hint that could point us in the right direction, however, we may have a niche situation that may not be readily available. At this point, we have only one solution to help alleviate the issue, and that's to go out and ask the question to other people. This is where things may get a bit unwieldy.

When we try to ask a question to the the masses and the perhaps more experienced people, it's of the utmost importance that we ask questions in a smart way. By asking a question, one not only uses their own time, but also the time of the person that reads it. When a problem needs to be solved, it should be solved in the most efficient manner possible. This can be achieved by being as detailed as possible without writing a story. Be concise with your architecture, issues, and what the outcome should be. One should also briefly go over some of the solution that they tried as to eliminate any unnecessary work. Most importantly, write your question so that they are not a pain to read because someone who's using their own time will not waste it just trying to decode your question.

Now, let's look at an example of a good and a bad way to ask a question. First, let look at a bad question that can be found <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48453553/how-to-reach-each-pc-in-an-organisation-unit-in-java">here.</a> The most glaring issue in this example is the fact that it seems as though the person asking the question put no thought into a solution. They did not even try to figure something out before asking. We see that the post is downvoted and one person even took the time to explain why. The person that explained why he downvoted essentially said that it's because the person asking the question wanted to be spoon fed the answer. The person put in low effort into their question and received low effort answers. Now, let's take a look at a good question that can be found <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48453852/same-while-loop-code-giving-different-results-on-different-android-devices-sc">here.</a> As we can see, the title from this question is more or less concise, stating the problem and the architecture. We also see from reading further, that the person has written his code and presented it and has tested it on various devices. The person has stated how to reproduce the issue and has offered further speculation that may pertain to the issue.

Smart questions are important for software engineers because there will be times that something difficult will occur and further assistance is needed. By asking smart questions, it reduces the delay between asking the question and receiving an answer. Smart questions present the problem as clearly as possible and potentially allow someone else to find the problem without further information, allowing for faster answers. As we see from the two examples above, a smart question will receive more attention and the help from others while anything else may end up just being disregarded. Asking a smart question helps both the person asking and the person responding.

To conclude, to easiest way to get answers from other people is to ask a smart question. Put thought and effort and show that you did try the best you could before coming out to the community. People will be more willing to help someone that has taken the time to understand their issue and just need a little push towards the right direction.
