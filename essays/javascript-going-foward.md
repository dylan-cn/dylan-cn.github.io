As you may have read before, C# was the first programming language that I was exposed to. I learned mostly from studying the source code that I had at the time. I would find snippets of code and try to deduce what they were doing to eventually figure out its meaning. This usually also involved trying research the different types of things that I saw. Many of the aspects were some what easy to grasp such as if statements and while loops. However, there were certain things that were hard to fully understand, such as when it was the appropriate time to use the static keyword. This concept was hard to understand until I further learned more of the aspects of C#. This was a time of trial, error, and research.

After being exposed to C#, it was much more simpler trying to learn another language. In my case, it was C and then Java. Many of the concepts are the same, the if statements, while loops, and so forth. This could probably be said about most any programming language. Just as many have said "once you learn one, it's relatively easy to learn a new one".  However, the hardest part, at least for me, was learning the correct syntax. Once I've been repeated exposed to one syntax, it's hard to break the habit and use the correct syntax for a new language. With my limited experience with various programming languages, I would see myself as having it rather easy. The syntax between the languages that I've experienced are mostly relatable. 

Suddenly, just like that, Javascript comes up to my front door. The concept of once you know one programming language, it's easy to pick up on another one is easy also applies here. The various concepts are the same. However, the same difficulty applies here, the fact that I have to learn the syntax. Despite this obstacle, there's another obstacle that's glaring at me, eye to eye. The new problem that I face here is the fact that Javascript is dynamically typed. If we look back at my prior experience, the bulk of my knowledge focuses primarily on C# and Java with C being a distant fragment of my memory. All three of those languages have something in common... they're all statically typed. This might not be the hardest concept to understand, however, it's one that will at least take me some time to get used to. In Javascript, I can have a function return anything, whereas previously, I would be limited to the return type of the function. This may not be the only obstacle I face as I've only touched the surface of Javascript.

As a result, I'm now encountering something that I haven't seen before. This is the start of a new journey... seeing Javascript and Beyond.
