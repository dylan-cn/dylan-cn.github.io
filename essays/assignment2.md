## 1. Provide a brief introduction to the assignment along with a link to this page for further details
>The objective of Assignment 2 is to use file IO to make data persistent, providing restrictions to pages, and a crude login and registration system. Assignment 2 can be found at https://dport96.github.io/ITM352/morea/150.Assignment2/experience-Assignment2.html
## 2. What did you learn from this assignment?
>I think most of this assignment was mostly reinforcing concepts that I mostly already knew previously, at least to the extent needed for the assignment.
## 3. Did you work with a partner? Assign an estimated percentage on the amount each team member contributed to the assignment (including yourself).
>I worked with a single partner for this assignment. I would estimate contribution to be even.
## 4. How did you get help when you needed it? What did you need help with?
>Instead of help, it was more so guidance that I sought from the professor. The guidance that I needed revolved around figuring out a better way to generate the needed HTML, based on the data. At first, the HTML was generated on the server and sent as the response. However, I ended up changing it so that the server simply responded with relevant data, and the client was left with the task of generating the HTML.
## 5. How was developing this assignment different than assignment #1?
>This assignment was different in that it was more involved than assignment 1. The complexity increased as more requirements were put into place. There were also restrictions on what could not be used, such as cookies and sessions. This resulted in having to spend a little bit more time figuring out how to accomplish the tasks.
## 6. Estimate the % of time you spent (a) thinking about how to do something, (b) writing code (but do not include testing, (c) testing and debugging
>Due to the restrictions on what could be used, thinking about how to implement a system that fulfilled the requirements took the most time. I would estimate that 60% of the time was devoted to actually figuring out the implementation. The rest of the time was probably split evenly among writing the code and testing it.
## 7. Describe what worked well with this project? What did not work well?
>Overall, I think everything worked well in this project, with the one exception being client routing. Because I tried the approach of trying to implement a single-page application format, without the use of frameworks and libraries, everything was crammed into a single page, which allowed for not having to load other pages. However, this resulted in not having specific endpoints to go to certain pages, meaning that a client cannot go directly to the store, for example. A refresh of the page, no matter what is display, will result in being shown the homepage.
## 8. If you could go back in time and do things differently, what would you do differently?
>If I could do this assignment again, I would either try to implement hash based routing, or just separate the pages.
