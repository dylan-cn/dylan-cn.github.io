Initially, I had started to code just for the sake of changing things to be the way I wanted it to be. I do not want to say what it was I was changing, however, there was code with logic that I did not agree with and I had the opportunity to change it to the way I saw fit as the source code was available to me. This was the very beginning to my exposure to anything related to code. It was a daunting task because at the time, I had no prior knowledge to it. I began my task by simply looking at the various parts of the code and figuring out what each thing did. This was a time consuming task, however, in the end I was able to make my way through it, more or less, through trial, error and research. I was able to implement my knowledge, successfully, as the things I wanted to do focused more on simple logic than anything complex. The language that I was experimenting with at that time was C#.

At some point, I eventually had taken a class for C and I was able to understand many things, disregarding the syntax and just the fundamental way of how C handles code vs how C# handles code. For example, C# has more or less automatic memeory management while C does not. However, through the class that I took for C, I was able to further my understanding and correct my misunderstandings of various coding concepts.

Through the knowledge that I gained, I would eventually be able to write my own programs, despite being very simplistic in nature. I would find ways to try to automate things that I would otherwise do manually by hand. Granted, there's a high change the things I wanted have already been made, however, at this point, it was the fact that I could potentially create something on my own to solve my issues. This was a very rewarding thing for me to accomplish.

Since I essentially learned things on my own, I probably ended up picking up bad habits. Either through the way I implement various things to the way I set up programs that utilize a GUI. I have seen several concepts such as Model View Controller (MVC) and have tried implementations of them. It is a daunting task as it's hard for me to learn it effectively because I'm not entirely sure what I should be learning.

As a result, through my time in ICS 314, Software Engineering, I hope to further my understanding and skills in effective coding practices.
