Just to preface this, I came into ITM352 with the experience gained from personal learning, ICS311, ICS314, ICS321, and all of its prerequisites.

## 1. My programming skills have greatly improved.
> From the class alone, I do not think my programming skills have significantly improved, at least up to this point. However, this is due to the fact that I have come into this class with prior knowledge. A lot of time was mostly spent on basics, which is what I know already. However, through Assignment 1, I was able to tackle learning React hooks as best I could.
## 2. I am enthusiastic about programming.
> I can say that I am enthusiastic about programming because this is something I enjoy as a hobby. Up to this point, the languages that I have used include C, C++, C#, Java, and  Javascript. Some I did not delve too deep into and have probably forgotten the intricacies of due to lack of use, but these are the ones that I have at least used to some extent.
## 3. I can do the practice WODs without looking at the screencast solutions.
> I think I can mostly do the practice WODs without the screencast. There may be some things that I have to look up because I do not remember everything, such as css properties.
## 4. The labs have helped me to learn and I am able to complete them with confidence.
> Since the majority of the labs were focused on the basics, I did not learn anything that was totally unfamiliar to me. The concepts were more or less reinforcing the things that I already knew, at least to some capacity. The lab that I learned the most off of was probably the lab involving Express. Prior to the class, I had not learned the framework, however, it is something that I knew of. So this gave a good starting point, at least for syntax sake.
## 5. I feel ready to move to the next stage of complexity in programming (building small web applications).
> I am most interested in trying to develop more advantaged web apps and I feel that, yes, I am ready to move on. Previous to this class, I had built some web apps using Meteor, React, and MongoDB. Meteor made it relatively easy to set up user accounts and handled authentication. It also made it painless to connect to a MongoDB database. I have also used very primitive PHP to access a MySQL database. Therefore, the things that I would like to see include authentication and database usage (either SQL or NoSQL). I would also like to see the process of actually deploying a project to production, as this seems like a topic that is never really taught in classes.
## 6. I think the class can be improved to help my learning.
> There are several things that I think can be improved on to help people learn the content, at least from the viewpoint of never having touched these technologies before. HTML and CSS should be taught independently from Javascript. This is so that it can be solidified that they complement each other and are not one in the same. Javascript should be taught before even trying to integrate it with the HTML side of things. For example, when server side processing was introduced it used things like functions and objects. There was almost no Javascript foundation set up at that point, so the material taught was kind of just force fed. These two problems, at least to me, seem off-putting. Yes, people need to work to understand the material, however, the culmination of trying to throw so much at a person (potentially confusing them a whole lot) and leaving them helpless will not necessarily motivate them to want to learn further.
## 7. There are things that work really well in my learning in this class.
>The first language I tried to learn was C# and this was not under a structured course of some kind. This was purely from my desire to change the functionality of a program, that I had access to the source code, and just using trial and error. Some of the things were somewhat intuitive, like if statements, however, the syntax, arrays for example, was something I had to search up. This is why I think the examples in class help a lot because I learn through examples. However, perhaps because the labs essentially become copy and paste, homework should be introduced that utilize the concepts learned from the labs.
