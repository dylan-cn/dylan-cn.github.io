Hello. My name is Dylan Nakamoto and I am currently an undergraduate in Shidler at the Univeristy of Hawaii. 

<br/>

Originally, I was a computer science major, however, at some point, I felt that this might not actually be the major that I wanted. This was when I found out about the MIS program. The reason why I chose MIS is because after having spent some time looking in to things, I felt that MIS might be the better match for myself, moreso than computer science was.
