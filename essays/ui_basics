The objective of the UI Basics WoDs (BrowserHistory 1, 2, 3) was essentially to create a simple static webpage with a navbar directing to the various sections. The objective of BrowserHistory2 was to add some styling on top of BrowserHistory1. BrowserHistory3 took the styling further than BrowserHistory2. The browser sections were changed so that they were more akin to inline elements, where it took on the appearance of columns instead of rows.

These WoDs were more of a review on my part. BrowserHistory1 and BrowserHistory2 were relatively easy and I was able to complete thes in rx time. However, BrowserHistory3 was a little more tricky and it took a little more time to finish this one. The main obstacle of BrowserHistory3 was figuring out how to make the columns and centering the content. After a few Google searches, the problem was solved.

The WoDs should typically be attempted without having viewed the screencast prior. This tests the knowledge you know and finds the spots that can be further developed. When attempting to redo the WoDs, I suggest waiting some time inbetween attempts. This way you do not just write down snippets you remember, not that this is necessarily a bad thing. However, doing it this way, you kind of have to figure out again how to approach certain problems. Do not get frustrated because, in this case, practice really does help.
