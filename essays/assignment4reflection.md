1.         What was accomplished in the project as compared to what was planned?
We were able to get many of the features that we wanted into the project. Probably the most important thing that did not get added was the ability to modify existing products. However, this functionality is not necessarily needed as products can just be deleted and added again. The website was designed to be very minimalist as that was mentioned from the client, so not too much went into styling, such as background images, etc.
 
2.         Any notable shortcomings, bugs, problems, or additional features not implemented?
The only notable feature that was not implemented was the ability to edit products, however, as described above, there is a work around for this and it is not entirely needed.
 
3.         What was your biggest project risk and how was it managed?
Since this project was designed to be reflective of a real client, there was a lot to do in terms of functionality. As a result, the biggest risk we had was the time constraints. This was managed by meeting with my group continuous from the time the assignment was started to the end.
 
4.         What is your assessment of the overall quality of the system?
The overall quality of the system is good, at least in terms of this class. However, due to the time constraints, not a lot of thorough planning was able to be accomplished. This caused us to take some short cuts when writing out the application. However, despite that, we were able to get a functional website that hits major requirements.
 
5.         What is needed before this system can be placed into operation?
The application needs to be optimized, including best practices. Due to the time constraints, not everything was done in the most appropriate way. Some branding should also be done so that the application is more unique to the client. There should also be a better system in place to send success or failure messages from the server. For example, failures in adding products, etc.
 
6.         Describe what you are most proud of about this project:
I am most proud of the amount of functionality that was accomplished with this project. This was pretty much a full stack experience as we had to write out the backend for data access and the front end for viewing and manipulating data.
 
7.         Describe what you are least happy with this project:
I am least happy about the looks of everything as most of the time was dedicated to actually getting functionality done. It may not look the best, however, much of the functionality that was needed is there.
 
8.         Assign an estimated percentage on the amount each team member contributed to the assignment (including yourself) and explain briefly your rationale for the percentage breakdown. Be sure to include an overview of what specifically you and your partners contributed (e.g. "I worked on the security and my partner 1 worked on personalization"):
I would say that the contribution was evenly split between Mikella and I. I worked on user login and registration. This includes roles and authorization so that the server can distinguish between normal users and admin users. This ensures that only admins are able to modify certain things in the database, such as products and orders. Mikella played a large role in terms of the user experience, including the position and flow of the content. Besides these things, Mikella and I worked on everything else together.
