The objective of BrowserHistory6 was to utilize javascript to make the web page a little more interactive. This was through the use of onclick and onmouseover events. Mousing over a button showed a "preview" of the content, whereas a click send the client to the actual page of the content.

In this lab, the hardest part was trying to write javascript inline with the html. This slowed me down the most because trying to write the correct syntax in this manner is particularly difficult. This was fixed through the use of javascript functions so that I could just call the function without having to write all the code in with the html.

To prepare for this WOD, I did a brief review over javascript that was learned up to this point. In performing this WOD, I chose to review some of the material rather than going straight into it.

For the next WOD, there is not anything in particular that I woul do different. Having reviewed the material necessary for the WOD was sufficient to allow for me to complete it within time. However, using a laptop is actually a limiting factor when performing WODs just purely because of screen real estate. A lot of time can be cut out just having a large screen to see everything from.
