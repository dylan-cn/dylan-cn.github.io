Just as a disclaimer, my knowledge and expertise in HTML, CSS and by extension, Semantic UI are limited and so my experience may be somewhat of a polar opposite to others. However, despite this, I’ll try to lay out my thoughts and experiences with my encounter with these various languages.

HTML and CSS, used together, make up the presentation portion of a website and is, comparatively, a whole other beast when compared to a “real” programming language. There are many intricacies laid out within HTML and CSS that it becomes very easy to back oneself into a corner. One might add a line, thinking that it’s doing exactly what they want, only to find out that it didn’t do what was originally planned. Like any language, expertise comes over time. With practice and determination, many of the intricacies become second nature so that mistakes become less and less common.

To help make web development easier, UI Frameworks have risen up as an extension to HTML and CSS. These frameworks allow one to have easier access to different components that are utilized to make up the UI of a website. In the case of Semantic UI, declaration of these components uses common language and patterns found in natural languages. This allows for more concise statements to be made about components. Ultimately, using a UI Framework, Semantic UI in this case, allows for a more intuitive, plug and play approach to building the visual aspect of a website.

In my personal experience, it was rough getting around Semantic UI. The major obstacle was the fact that, at this point, I wouldn’t consider myself to be anywhere near proficient in the use of just HTML and CSS. I was stuck between a rock and a hard place and then in came Semantic UI and it was as if the rock was replaced by a mountain. Now, I had to learn how to utilize and manipulate the components and syntax of Semantic UI. For example, in Semantic UI, a row in a grid is made up of 16 columns, by default, and it takes a bit of time to learn how to manipulate it so that it does what you want it to do. This example can be extended to many of the other components of Semantic UI.

However, despite my experience thus far, I think that these UI Frameworks can be a great tool once the concepts of it are fully grasped. Just like any tool, it takes time and practice to gain mastery with it. UI Frameworks takes normal HTML and extends upon it by allowing for easier component creation. Segments on a website can become more easily created and manipulated to get the desired results. If one can push through and learn all of the intricacies of Semantic UI, or potentially any UI Framework, then it becomes a huge tool that can make the work easier and efficient.
